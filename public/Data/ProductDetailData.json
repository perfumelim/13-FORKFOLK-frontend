Originally commissioned for Kinfolk’s Summer 2019 issue, the series Le Chat Chic saw Braquet and stylist Tania Rat-Patron try something a little different: They transformed Socrate into a Parisian glamour puss—and one of the magazine’s most popular models of all time. For The Kinfolk Print Collection, Socrate waves a classic Hermès silk scarf with carefree abandon. Fur coat: Model’s own."
